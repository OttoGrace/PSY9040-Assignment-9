# Mean of an Array

Write a program that asks the user to enter 5 numbers, and then prints the arithmetic mean of those numbers.

For example:

```
Enter 5 numbers:
number 1: 5
number 2: 3.14
number 3: 1.23
number 4: 100
number 5: 0.01

The mean of [5.00, 3.14, 1.23, 100.00, 0.01] is 21.88
```

# Bonus Challenge
Do not use any built-in functions for calculating the mean. Instead code it up from scratch.

# Solution
A sample solution is found in ```A9_GO.ipynb```. The file is written in Python, contained in a Jupyter Notebook file. The code can be run by simply downloading the file, opening in VS code or Anaconda and pressing "run" in the code file. 
The code will ask for 5 numerical inputs, one at a time, as a pop up (in VS code) or underneath the code (in Anaconda).
